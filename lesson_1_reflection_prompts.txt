How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?


Easier to spot changes that might affect the different outcomes

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?


Able to see changes made at different points in time, able to help identify areas for optimization



What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?


manual - pro, able to flag meaningful events with commit, con: might forget. Auto: pro: forces you to commit so can't forget, con: might be difficult to look back into history

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?


Maybe some applications are composed of multiple files and version control on each is significant, or maybe it only matters at the application level

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
track where changes were made and what they were. help debug



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
Very confident because you can always go back



Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
My personal app...?
